        <h1>Instructions:</h1>
    </i>

    <i>
        <h2>Marinate the Chicken:</h2>
    </i>

    <p>If you have boneless chicken breasts, cut them into bite-sized pieces. If using bone-in chicken thighs, you can
        leave them whole. </br>
        In a bowl, mix the chicken with olive oil, minced garlic, ginger, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, cinnamon,
        cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper.</br> Ensure the chicken is evenly coated with the spices. Cover and refrigerate for
        at least 30 minutes to marinate. </br>For better results, marinate for a few hours or overnight.</p>
    <i>
        <h2>Sear the Chicken:</h2>
    </i>

    <p>Heat a large skillet or pan over medium-high heat. Add a bit more olive oil if needed.</br>
        Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook until they are browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes.</br> Remove the
        chicken from the pan and set it aside.</p>

    <i>
        <h2>Saute Onions:</h2>
    </i>

    <p>In the same pan, add the finely chopped onion and saut√© until it becomes soft and translucent, about 3-4 minutes.
    </p>

    <i>
        <h2>Add Tomatoes and Spices:</h2>
    </i>

    <p>Add the diced tomatoes (with their juice) to the pan and stir well to combine with the onions.</br>
        Add the chicken broth and stir again.</br>
        Return the seared chicken to the pan and bring the mixture to a simmer.</p>

    <i>
        <h2>Simmer and Cook:</h2>
    </i>

    <p>Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked
        through and tender. Stir occasionally.</p>

    <i>
        <h2>Finish with Yogurt:</h2>
    </i>

    <p>Once the chicken is cooked, stir in the plain yogurt. This will add creaminess to the sauce. Cook for an
        additional 2-3 minutes, just until heated through.</br> Do not let it boil after adding the yogurt, as it may curdle.
    </p>

    <i>
        <h2>Serve:</h2>
    </i>

    <p>Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary by adding more salt, pepper, or cayenne pepper.</br>
        Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.</br>
        Serve the Halal chicken curry over cooked rice or with naan bread.</br>
        Enjoy your homemade chicken dish!</p>
